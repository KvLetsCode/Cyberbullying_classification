# Cyberbullying_classification

	INTRODUCTION:  With rise of social media coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, cyberbullying has reached all-time highs. We can combat this by creating models to automatically flag potentially harmful tweets as well as break down the patterns of hatred.

Steps Involved:

1.	Importing Dependencies
2.	Scrapping the Data
3.	Data Preprocessing:

•	Text generalization: removing puntuations and numbers from the text. 

•	Tokenization: making word tokens from the review texts.

•	Stemming and Lemmatization: finding the root word for any word that has been used in the review text(eg. see/saw/seen was stemmed to its root word "see").

•	TF/IDF: machine learning models needs data to be in vector format for training, tf/idf created the vector formant for the review texts.

•	Train/Test split: splitting data for training and testing.


4.	Exploratory Data Analysis
5.	Tf-Idf Vectorizer
6.	Model  Building
7.	Training Model
8.	Making Prediction
9.	Finding Accuracy
